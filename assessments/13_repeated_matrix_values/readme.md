# Repeated Matrix Values

Write a function that takes in a non-empty two-dimensional integer array (a matrix) of potentially unequal height and width and returns a list of the elements that appear at least once in each row and each column of the matrix.

## Sample Input

```
matrix = [
  [1, 3, 7, 4, 5],
  [2, 5, 9, 3, 3],
  [1, 8, 5, 3, 5],
  [5, 0, 3, 5, 6],
  [3, 8, 3, 5, 6],
  [1, 0, 3, 0, 5],
] 
```

## Sample Output

``` 
[3, 5] // The numbers could be ordered differently.
```
