# Count Contained Permutations

You're given two non-empty strings: a big string and a small string. Write a function that returns the number of permutations of the small string that are contained in the big string.

Repeated permutations should be counted, and the small string counts as a permutation of itself.

## Sample Input

``` 
bigString = "cbabcacabca"
smallString = "abc"
```

## Sample Output

``` 
6 // "cba", "abc", "bca", "cab", "abc", "bca"
```
